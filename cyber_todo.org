Sometimes

* TODO Text

Text is quite hard to read, partly because it is flickering unless very imprecise.

It is easier to read text drawn a few letters at a time.

** DONE Implement functions for drawing a text message over time, a few letters at a time

** DONE All the letters

* TODO Activity points

** TODO Limit number of activity points to improve speed
If there are too many points already, maybe some points can merge into one bigger point?

** DONE Draw activity points as points
Drawing points instead of circles is waaaay faster.

* User views
** TODO Fix user move coordinate
** TODO Show all user events separately

* TODO Transitions between states

# ** TODO Fly into one of the circles of the triangle
Maybe spin around at the end to reveal like the inside?

Looks good on the laser!! I need to fix the issue with zooming into/out of a specific spot.

** DONE Spin around to switch between states for the same position

* TODO Automatically connect and arm laser on startup
* View ideas

** DONE Let scrolling text from events fly across the screen

** TODO More details about the architecture in the zoomed out view
More details could be optionally drawn on the same view
- Different connected users (who have made an action in the last n seconds)
- Different parts of the server structure
- Different parts that are in the room (laser, DAC, webcams, server, projector)

** NO Rain of ftrace events
Different colours for different events
Tested: doesn't work, the laer doesn't have time to draw them and the colours don't work with low intensity dots.

** TODO Stack trace like view?

** TODO Heartbeat monitor for events

** TODO User view for events per user

** TODO One colour per source of data
- users
- server
- room and OS

** TODO More events in the web server view

* Knowledge Base

** Dot intensity
It seems like the maximum dot intensity is approximately 1.0 / (number_of_dots * 4)
